# Dilated, residual, gated CNN

This is a PyTorch implementation of the network presented in Chang et al "Temporal Modeling Using Dilated Convolution and Gating for Voice-Activity-Detection" 2018 [Link to paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8461921)

The network is used for Voice Activity Detection (VAD) in the paper
